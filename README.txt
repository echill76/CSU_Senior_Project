Hello! Welcome to my Senior Project code hosting repository!

This is the code hosting solely for the web scraper part of my project. The actual game app and database backend are located on Oracle APEX.

Any files other than the main web scraper source code Python files and the CSV & HTML files they output are purely for legacy purposes.
